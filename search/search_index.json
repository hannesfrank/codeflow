Preamble The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program. If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands show w' and show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\". You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

They merge independent software development tools, such as source code editors, build automation tools, and debuggers, together in one bigger application. But there is no clear boundary if something should be called an IDE or a supporting tool. In general, the usage of an IDE will simplify installing the environment and will speed up code refactoring. IDEs tend to use up a huge amount of memory on the RAM. For a beginner, lots of things are made too simple so that learning is not really possible. A typical solution is a mini IDE. In the following, the basic toolchain for a C++ project will be shown. Every part will be discussed as an independent tool. This explains the interaction. If one should use a full-blown IDE or a mini IDE is left to the reader. Click on the image to get the according PDF. Operating System \u00b6 Recommendation Use a Linux distribution. The operating system is the most basic part of the development environment and is used in every single stage of a software project. Hence, it should support the development workflow in such a way that the programmer should not realize its existence. Therefore an ideal operating system for development would fulfill the following conditions. lightweight (older hardware should be capable of running this system) optimized for the hardware it is used on fast installation to new hardware fast booting and shutdown short response times (user should not wait) efficient interaction and communication with user (for example via a terminal through keyboard) capable of graphical output (humans are more attracted to nice looking designs) fast internet browsing for research fast installation of new packages and tools from modern repositories easily upgradeable without being forced to good defaults so no real configuration is needed compatibility to all development tools easy to learn for newcomers open source system / providing ways to use open source software free to use In reality there is no operating system which fulfills all these conditions. As a consequence we look for the best subset. In our experience any Linux distribution seems to be a really good candidate. Most Linux distributions are lightweight, easy to install, fast to boot and shutdown and free to use. With nearly every distribution coding and installing tools can be done without problems. Upgrading a Linux distribution can be done manually. Choosing a specific Linux distribution is a matter of taste. But we recommend one of the following. - Ubuntu/Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint) - Arch-based (Arch, Manjaro) Shell \u00b6 Recommendation Use a modern and efficient shell, like fish , elvish , ion , or try to adhere to the standard with bash or zsh . The shell is one of the most frequently used applications while developing. It is a user interface to access the services of an operating system and therefore the only possibility for a user besides the GUI to communicate with the operating system. Because of that the shell usage has to be highly optimized such that it not intervenes with the thought process or the actual development workflow. There are some resulting conditions a shell should fulfill. lightweight and fast to startup multiple instances easy scripting with easy syntax ease to learn for newcomers features that support navigation and search short response times good history tracking and usage easy configuration good defaults so no configuration is needed high availability on different systems independent of the operating system good handling of environment variables Again, there is no shell which fulfills every condition. Our suggestion is to think about modern alternatives. fish : easy to install, learn, use and script with support for all systems elvish : efficient with good features for history and navigation xonsh : superset of python and currently in development ion : really efficient But if you really want to have high availability of your shell then you should stick to bash , zsh or dash . Version Control System \u00b6 Recommendation Use Git as your version control system. Version control systems (VCS) are software programs that record changes to a file or a set of files over time so that it is possible to recall specific versions later. Therefore a VCS is a versatile alternative to the plain old backup process of manually copying folders. This makes it indispensable while working on the code for a project. Currently, the de-facto standard seems to be Git. Alternatives are given by Subversion, also known as SVN, and Mercurial. The overall performance of a VCS can be characterized by the following points. Centralized vs. Distributed Speed and Efficiency Compression Model and Memory Efficiency Command-Line Interface: Easy/Powerful/Low-Level/Abstraction Branching Model Learning Curve Level of Knowledge Needed Creation of New Repositories Server Setup Access Granularity Security Large-Project Scaling Availability and Interaction with External Tools Merge Strategies Group Capabilities Workflows New Feature Inclusion from External Users Property Git SVN Mercurial Centralized vs. Distributed Distributed Centralized Distributed References: Git Subversion SVN Mercurial https://svnvsgit.com/ https://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/ https://ikriv.com/blog/?p=1905 Text Editor \u00b6 Recommendation Use Sublime Text , Atom or Visual Studio Code as your main general-purpose graphical text editor with your custom configurations and snippets. Use simple and standard command-line editors like vim or emacs for editing configuration files in place if there is only a command-line available. As a software developer your major work will have to do with source code. In general one uses a text editor to display code to work on it. Because of this the text editor has to be highly optimized like in the case of the shell. lightweight and fast (multiple instances) really efficient user interaction via keyboard and shortcuts (programmer has to work with the keyboard anyway) project handling (working on different projects at the same time) good interaction with shell (shell access should be fast) highly customizable through configurations and packages good defaults such that configuration is not really needed easy and fast package installation process simple and attractive design easy to learn for newcomers integrated build systems when needed useful for different languages Compiler \u00b6 Recommendation Use GCC compiler g++ , LLVM compiler clang and Intel C++ compiler icpc . On Windows use MinGW compiler g++ . Build System and Package Manager \u00b6 Recommendation For your own smaller projects use a modern build system with support for package managers, like build2 . For larger projects use modern CMake and think about providing support for build2 . Version Control System Server \u00b6 Recommendation Use an external hosting platform, such as GitHub or Bitbucket, or set up your own server, like Gitea. There are no real boundaries when choosing the hosting platform for your code repositories handled by the version control system. External hosting platforms, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, provide an easy web interface and are reliable with nearly no configuration needed. On the contrary, your code repositories may be private and you do not want them to reside on an external cloud storage. An alternative would be to set up your own Git server providing necessary storage and web access. A good choice for Git would be to use Gitea, which is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-set-up self-hosted Git server platform. Other alternatives include GitLab, GitWeb, and Gogs. If the web access is not needed, one can completely rely on the file system of the host computer without setting up any hosting platform. In the case of a self-hosted platform, one should further consider security issues, like HTTPS, and backup procedures, such as RAID.","title":"Basic Toolchain"},{"location":"programming/basic_toolchain/#basic-toolchain","text":"","title":"Basic Toolchain"},{"location":"programming/basic_toolchain/#notes-on-integrated-development-environments","text":"Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software applications for computer programmers to support the process of writing and debugging code.

In the following, the basic toolchain for a C++ project will be shown. Every part will be discussed as an independent tool. This explains the interaction. If one should use a full-blown IDE or a mini IDE is left to the reader.

The operating system is the most basic part of the development environment and is used in every single stage of a software project. Hence, it should support the development workflow in such a way that the programmer should not realize its existence. Therefore an ideal operating system for development would fulfill the following conditions. lightweight (older hardware should be capable of running this system) optimized for the hardware it is used on fast installation to new hardware fast booting and shutdown short response times (user should not wait) efficient interaction and communication with user (for example via a terminal through keyboard) capable of graphical output (humans are more attracted to nice looking designs) fast internet browsing for research fast installation of new packages and tools from modern repositories easily upgradeable without being forced to good defaults so no real configuration is needed compatibility to all development tools easy to learn for newcomers open source system / providing ways to use open source software free to use In reality there is no operating system which fulfills all these conditions. As a consequence we look for the best subset. In our experience any Linux distribution seems to be a really good candidate. Most Linux distributions are lightweight, easy to install, fast to boot and shutdown and free to use. With nearly every distribution coding and installing tools can be done without problems. Upgrading a Linux distribution can be done manually. Choosing a specific Linux distribution is a matter of taste. But we recommend one of the following. - Ubuntu/Debian-based (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint) - Arch-based (Arch, Manjaro)","title":"Operating System"},{"location":"programming/basic_toolchain/#shell","text":"Recommendation Use a modern and efficient shell, like fish , elvish , ion , or try to adhere to the standard with bash or zsh . The shell is one of the most frequently used applications while developing. It is a user interface to access the services of an operating system and therefore the only possibility for a user besides the GUI to communicate with the operating system. Because of that the shell usage has to be highly optimized such that it not intervenes with the thought process or the actual development workflow. There are some resulting conditions a shell should fulfill. lightweight and fast to startup multiple instances easy scripting with easy syntax ease to learn for newcomers features that support navigation and search short response times good history tracking and usage easy configuration good defaults so no configuration is needed high availability on different systems independent of the operating system good handling of environment variables Again, there is no shell which fulfills every condition. Our suggestion is to think about modern alternatives. fish : easy to install, learn, use and script with support for all systems elvish : efficient with good features for history and navigation xonsh : superset of python and currently in development ion : really efficient But if you really want to have high availability of your shell then you should stick to bash , zsh or dash .","title":"Shell"},{"location":"programming/basic_toolchain/#version-control-system","text":"Recommendation Use Git as your version control system. Version control systems (VCS) are software programs that record changes to a file or a set of files over time so that it is possible to recall specific versions later. Therefore a VCS is a versatile alternative to the plain old backup process of manually copying folders. This makes it indispensable while working on the code for a project. Currently, the de-facto standard seems to be Git. Alternatives are given by Subversion, also known as SVN, and Mercurial. The overall performance of a VCS can be characterized by the following points. Centralized vs. Distributed Speed and Efficiency Compression Model and Memory Efficiency Command-Line Interface: Easy/Powerful/Low-Level/Abstraction Branching Model Learning Curve Level of Knowledge Needed Creation of New Repositories Server Setup Access Granularity Security Large-Project Scaling Availability and Interaction with External Tools Merge Strategies Group Capabilities Workflows New Feature Inclusion from External Users Property Git SVN Mercurial Centralized vs. Distributed Distributed Centralized Distributed References: Git Subversion SVN Mercurial https://svnvsgit.com/ https://stevebennett.me/2012/02/24/10-things-i-hate-about-git/ https://ikriv.com/blog/?p=1905","title":"Version Control System"},{"location":"programming/basic_toolchain/#text-editor","text":"Recommendation Use Sublime Text , Atom or Visual Studio Code as your main general-purpose graphical text editor with your custom configurations and snippets.

On the contrary, your code repositories may be private and you do not want them to reside on an external cloud storage.

By communicating with users, you are able to improve the code and the overall design of the project. The users on the other side are happy to see their comments implemented and will use the tool more intensive. But even if the user base consists only of a few people, it becomes tedious to explain the basic usage of your program or library every time your API has changed. Additionally, not every user wants to communicate with you directly. Hence, documenting your software is mandatory if you want people to use it. But on the other hand, creating documentation seems not to be rewarding. And therefore, one likes to ignore this part of writing code. I am not a technical writer. So I will not talk about how to actually write documentation for your software, such that it is understandable by everyone. Instead, I would like to give you an idea about how to start with the basics and how to create a system which looks professional and is easy to handle. The first impression counts. And so, even yourself may be tempted to write more and better documentation. Basic Techniques \u00b6 There are a lot of possibilities out there for documenting software. I am not able to cover all of them. But I will try to explain some basic approaches and to provide a few more elaborate techniques for handling your documentation. Comments \u00b6 Recommendation Use comments only to give other developers hints about design decisions in your implementation or interface. Writing comments inside your code is a great and easy way to provide some sort of documentation where the programming language itself is not able to make the intention clear. But most of the times it is an overused feature. Blocks of comments reduce the readability of your code tremendously. Doxygen , for example, is a documentation tool which builds upon comments inside your code. Its usage is deprecated, in my opinion. Instead, use comments in your code to explain details about special implementation or interface parts. As a result, comments make it possible to give other developers hints about design decisions in your implementation or interface, but they are not suitable for documenting the usage of your software. README File \u00b6 Recommendation Always keep a README file in the root of your project up-to-date. In general, you will use a code hosting platform, like GitHub or Bitbucket, to publish your git repository. These platforms will recognize and automatically surface a README file in the root of your project to repository visitors. A README file is often the first item a visitor will see. Additionally, you do not have to use a specific extension or format. You can create a README file as README.txt for a simple text-based approach, as README.md to write your text in Markdown, as README.rst to use the reST format or as other formats that are supported by your code hosting platform. Hence, it is a perfect starting point for the documentation of every project. It is fast and easy to create and gives some advanced utilities based on the format you are using. Nearly every developer would first try to find such a README file to learn something about your code. Advanced Techniques \u00b6 Recommendation If your documentation does not fit into a README.md file anymore then use MkDocs and GitHub Pages as a hosting platform. If the manual building of the documentation becomes too cumbersome, try to use ReadTheDocs. There will be a point in time when writing information into a README file will not suffice as documentation. Therefore, tools were developed to make things easier for developers and technical writers. If you need more than one file to structure your documentation, you will generally use a folder docs inside your repository where you will put all of your documentation files. This will reduce merge conflicts and therefore make it easier for a developer to add new documentation parts or change already existing ones. But for a user of the library or application, the new layer of indirection introduces overhead. As a developer, you should make it appealing to read the documentation. This is why we need tools which make it possible to display the documentation in a stylish way. There are two types of tools we need. First, we use a documentation builder that takes the documentation sources and generates the HTML webpage. Afterwards, we will push to a hosting platform which then provides worldwide access to the generated HTML webpage. Unfortunately, both of them have to be compatible with each other. Documentation Builder: Sphinx : It is an easy-to-use build system written in Python which is not only able to generate HTML webpages but also LaTeX PDF documents and other formats. Documentation sources can be written in reST and Markdown. MkDocs : This is a fast and simple static site generator written in Python mainly used for building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. Jekyll : This is a simple, extendable, static site generator written in Ruby. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more. Documentation Hosting Platform: ReadTheDocs : They call themselves a continuous documentation platform. For every commit, the documentation will be built and hosted. It is even possible to deploy different versions. Because of that, it is only possible to use Sphinx or MkDocs with it. GitHub Pages : This is a general hosting platform for static websites powered by GitHub and is therefore perfect to be integrated with your GitHub repositories. Nearly every static documentation builder should be compatible with it. But it is mainly used for Jekyll webpages. As an example, take a look at the build process of this documenation.

Instead, it aims at providing a workflow on how to start and integrate MkDocs in an ongoing project. Hence, this explanation should be useful if you want to learn how to start with a documentation and/or if your README.md of your project is not sufficient. Without loss of generality, we assume the name of the project to be codeflow and the name of the user to be lyrahgames . Please interchange both of them with your own preference. Requirements \u00b6 Python pip MkDocs Preliminaries \u00b6 Typically, the project files of your project codeflow will reside in their own directory, also known as the project directory , with the same name. In the most cases, the project directory is version-controlled by Git and as a result, we may as well call the respective directory the project repository . As an example, assume your project would be a C++ application. The content of the project could then be something like the following. codeflow \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/... \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 build/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bootstrap.build \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 root.build \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u251c\u2500\u2500 manifest \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.hpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md Here, we have some files and folders concerning Git, the chosen build system, the source code itself, license files, and the up-to-this-point-sufficient documentation in the file README.md . In a C++ project, we tend to use more than one configuration to build and test the source code of the project. As an example, we would like to build the project with the GCC and the Clang compiler. Due to their strong platform-dependence, these configurations should not be stored inside the project repository. Hence, they are not version-controlled by Git. To keep the overview over all those configurations, we use another parent directory again with the same name as the project. We call this parent directory the developer folder . In the following, the tree of the content for this example is shown. codeflow/ # Developer Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/ # Project Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/... \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 build/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bootstrap.build \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 root.build \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 manifest \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.hpp \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.cpp \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.cpp \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow-gcc/... # Configuration Folder 'gcc' \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 codeflow-clang/... # Configuration Folder 'clang' Initialization \u00b6 In the next step, we will initialize the documentation with its configuration. We assume that you are currently residing inside the developer folder of your project. $ pwd /home/lyrahgames/projects/codeflow Go into the project folder and create a directory for the documentation. Afterwards, initialize a new web documentation with MkDocs. cd codeflow mkdir docs cd docs mkdocs new web Note Sometimes the documentation for a project does not only exist as website readable by browsers but also as LaTeX documents or other presentations. In this case, we want to be able to keep such files inside the docs directory without changing the web documentation. Therefore we use another subdirectory called web . If you do want to keep things very simple then run mkdocs new docs inside your project folder. But please be aware that this will pollute your project folder with configuration files concerning MkDocs and its themes. We now have to make sure that Git is not ignoring those new files created by MkDocs. If you have chosen the white-listing approach for your .gitignore files, we can add something like the following to a new .gitignore file inside the web documentation folder. # File: docs/web/.gitignore !*.md !mkdocs.yml !requirements.txt Because MkDocs is based on Python, we additionally have created the file requirements.txt for the pip Package Manager to provide all requirements the documentation needs to be built.

So go into the web documentation folder, run the following command, and look at the result in your browser. mkdocs serve This finalizes the initialization process and as a good practice, a commit should be made.

MkDocs will automatically detect those files and show them in the table of contents inside your browser. But on the other hand, it may be a good idea to take some more time to configure the MkDocs build process to slightly tweak the generated documentation. Basics \u00b6 The complete configuration of MkDocs can be done by adjusting the file mkdocs.yml inside the web documentation folder. At first you should add the basic information about your project and its documentation. # File: docs/web/mkdocs.yml site_name : Codeflow site_url : https://lyrahgames.github.io/codeflow site_author : Markus Pawellek site_description : >- Tutorials, Explanations, Exercises, Solutions, Workflows referring to Coding and Sciences repo_name : lyrahgames/codeflow repo_url : https://github.com/lyrahgames/codeflow copyright : Copyright &copy; 2020 Markus Pawellek Theme \u00b6 Afterwards, in my opinion one of the main decisions has to be made. We have to choose a theme. I recommend to choose the Material for MkDocs theme . This theme comes with an extremely good documentation about its usage and configuration. Furthermore, it gives you some hints about what extensions and plugins to additionally add to your MkDocs configuration to make the documentation process easier and faster.

As an example for the Material theme, we will show how to set the alignment of content text blocks to the justify mode. For this, we use the override mechanism provided by the Material theme. First, create a new directory overrides in the web documentation folder. cd docs/web mkdir overrides cd overrides Now, open the new file main.html inside the folder overrides and add the following content. {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block content %} < style type = \"text/css\" > . justify { text-align : justify ; text-justify : inter-word ; } </ style > < section class = \"justify\" > {{ super() }} </ section > {% endblock %} Your current project folder structure should look like the following. codeflow # Project Folder \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/... \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 build/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bootstrap.build \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 root.build \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u251c\u2500\u2500 manifest \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ # Documentation Folder \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 web/ # Web Documentation Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ # Folder for the Actual Documentation Files \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 overrides/ # Material Theme Customization Folder \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.html # Customization for all Documentation Files \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.hpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md Build and Deploy \u00b6 After complete configuration and the writing of new documentation files, the generated site should be observed in the browser to test if all settings work as expected. This can be done again by using the command mkdocs serve . If everything seems to be alright, we have to build the documentation to actually get the files of the website. We want to push those files to a documentation hosting platform, in our case GitHub Pages, to make the documentation available to other people. Initialization \u00b6 First, we set up a new configuration folder inside the developer folder where all files of the generated documentation will be put. Because we want to use GitHub Pages as a hosting platform, we have to make sure to use a Git repository which is pushing to the branch gh-pages . Make sure that you are in the developer folder. $ pwd /home/lyrahgames/projects/codeflow Initialize a new Git repository, set it to the according branch, and provide the GitHub repository address as a remote by using the following commands. git init codeflow-gh-pages cd codeflow-gh-pages git checkout -b gh-pages git remote add origin git@github.com:lyrahgames/codeflow.git The structure of your developer folder should now look like this. codeflow/ # Developer Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/... # Project Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow-gcc/... # Configuration Folder 'gcc' \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow-clang/... # Configuration Folder 'clang' \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 codeflow-gh-pages/ # Configuration Folder for GitHub Pages The GitHub Pages environment on GitHub does not have to be turned on manually. GitHub should automatically enable this feature if the gh-pages branch is available in the GitHub repository. If this is not the case, enable the environment manually. Updating \u00b6 Building the documentation has to be done every time you want to push the changes to the hosting platform. To keep your GitHub repository consistent, you should first make a commit in the project folder and push it to the master branch of your GitHub repository. git add . git commit git push origin master Afterwards, you are now able to actually build the documentation into the configuration folder for GitHub Pages. Make sure to run the following command inside the web documentation folder. mkdocs build -d ../../../codeflow-gh-pages Now, we go into the configuration folder for GitHub Pages and commit its changes by amending to the previous commit. This makes sure the site will not be version-controlled by Git. We do not want it to be version-controlled because the generated site is a build artifact. cd ../../../codeflow-gh-pages git add . git commit --amend -m \"Update site\" Because we have amended to the previous commit, we have to do a force push to the gh-pages branch to update the documentation on the hosting platform. git push -f origin gh-pages. Automatic Documentation Generation Of course, it would be possible to automatically generate the documentation with a CI environment. But we do not recommend it. For this, we would need another server which additionally would have to be configured. This may introduce unnecessary version controlling for the generated site and as a result unnecessary memory usage of the repository. For a simple documentation site, this may be too much overhead. If one would not want to use GitHub Pages, we could use ReadTheDocs to automatically generate every commit to the master branch. Making it Easier through Scripts \u00b6 If you are frequently writing the documentation of your project on different platforms, it can become cumbersome to run all the commands for the initialization, building, and deploying every time. To make it easier and faster, we can provide simple scripts that allow us to do these processes in one simple step. Here, it is done for a Linux-based operating system. We will create two shell scripts, init.sh for the initialization and build_and_deploy.sh for the building and deployment, inside the web documentation folder. Your current project folder structure should then look like the following. codeflow # Project Folder \u251c\u2500\u2500 .git/... \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 build/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 bootstrap.build \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 root.build \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u251c\u2500\u2500 manifest \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ # Documentation Folder \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 web/ # Web Documentation Folder \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ # Folder for the Actual Documentation Files \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.html \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 init.sh # Shell Script for Initialization \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 build_and_deploy.sh # Shell Script for Building and Deployment \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 codeflow/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application.hpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 buildfile \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.cpp \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md Both scripts only contain the commands that were already described in the above sections. Additionally, we have added a mechanism to determine the current folder and changing the current directory to the directory where the script itself lies. This makes sure there will be no problems when the scripts are called from another directory. # File: docs/web/init.sh #!/bin/sh # Make sure to run the run the commands in the web documentation folder. doc_dir = ` dirname \" $0 \" ` cd $doc_dir # Install all requirements to be able to build the documentation. pip install -r requirements.txt # Create a configuration folder for the gh-pages branch next to the # project folder and hopefully inside the developer folder. # After building the documentation, we typically do a force push to # the remote repository. Hence, it is enough to create a new repository # and not to clone the remote repository. # We can even run these commands if there is no gh-pages branch available. cd ../../.. git init codeflow-gh-pages cd codeflow-gh-pages git checkout -b gh-pages git remote add origin git@github.com:lyrahgames/codeflow.git touch index.html git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" # Alternative initialization process using cloning. # cd ../../.. # git clone git@github.com:lyrahgames/codeflow.git --branch gh-pages --single-branch codeflow-gh-pages # cd codeflow-gh-pages # git checkout gh-pages # File: docs/web/build_and_deploy.sh #!/bin/sh # Make sure to run the run the commands in the web documentation folder. doc_dir = ` dirname \" $0 \" ` cd $doc_dir # Build the documentation into the GitHub Pages configuration folder. mkdocs build -d ../../../codeflow-gh-pages # Deploy the documentation by amending the changes to disable version control # and by force pushing to the remote repository. cd ../../../codeflow-gh-pages git add . git commit --amend -m \"Update site\" git push -f origin gh-pages Of course, we have to slightly change the .gitignore file to allow the shell scripts to be captured by Git. # File: docs/web/.gitignore !overrides/*.html !mkdocs.yml !requirements.txt !*.sh Afterwards, we set the executable flags to be able to run the scripts from the command line. chmod +x init.sh build_and_deploy.sh For the future this means, after cloning the repository, one should execute the init.sh script to generate the GitHub Pages configuration folder. After changing the documentation and committing the result, one should call the build_and_deploy.sh script to push the newly created site to documentation hosting platform. Note Going one step further, we could even think about using Git hooks to automatically run the build_and_deploy.sh script for every commit on the master branch.

It provides different standard styles and custom configuration possibilities. Its usage lets you think more about the content of your code instead of its appearance. Most text editors provide packages to automatically run clang-format every time a specific file was changed or saved. But all this automation can introduce certain kinds of artifacts. Take the following example: pair < int , int > array [] = {{ 1 , 2 }, { 2 , 3 }, { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, { 5 , 6 }, { 6 , 7 }, { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 }}; Applying clang-format to this piece of code will result in the following code snippet. pair < int , int > array [] = {{ 1 , 2 }, { 2 , 3 }, { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, { 5 , 6 }, { 6 , 7 }, { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 }}; A newline character has been added between the forth and the fifth element. In most cases, this generic insertion of newline characters may be good enough. But let us assume you would like to have a newline character right after the equality sign. Applying clang-format will always result in the code snippet shown above. Hence, we somehow have to instruct clang-format to keep and insert newlines when needed. One way of doing this is to disable formatting on a piece of code by using the comments // clang-format on and // clang-format off . // clang-format off pair < int , int > array [] = {{ 1 , 2 }, { 2 , 3 }, { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, { 5 , 6 }, { 6 , 7 }, { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 }}; // clang-format on This method consists of certain drawbacks. First, we do not want to mention clang-format inside our code. Another issue is that by adding these comments, we have completely disabled the automatic formatting. But we only wanted to force clang-format to add one newline character. A much better solution is given by the following idea. We add an empty comment in front of newline characters we would like to keep. pair < int , int > array [] = // {{ 1 , 2 }, { 2 , 3 }, { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, { 5 , 6 }, { 6 , 7 }, { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 }}; In this case, clang-format will not remove the newline character and therefore keep the custom formatting. Additionally, clang-format is not mentioned in the code and all other parts will still be formatted automatically. Of course, it is possible to go even further. For example, by inserting newline characters after every second element in the array we get the following. pair < int , int > array [] = { { 1 , 2 }, { 2 , 3 }, // { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, // { 5 , 6 }, { 6 , 7 }, // { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 } // }; Special formatting is possible as well. pair < int , int > array [] = { { 1 , 2 }, // { 2 , 3 }, { 3 , 4 }, { 4 , 5 }, { 5 , 6 }, // { 6 , 7 }, { 7 , 8 }, { 8 , 9 } // }; So next time clang-format does not format the code the way you like it, think about the insertion of empty comments to force newline characters.","title":"Forcing Newlines while using clang-format"},{"location":"programming/c%2B%2B/cmake_taming_the_beast/","text":"CMake is more or less the current standard used by nearly all C++ developers to configure, build and install their software.

For a program to run, its source text has to be processed by a compiler, producing object files, which are combined by a linker yielding an executable program. Especially for C and C++ there exists a so called preprocessor, which replaces strings in a source based on defined macros. A C++ program typically consists of many source code files (usually simply called source files). Click on the image to get the PDF. An executable program is created for a specific hardware/system combination; it is not portable, say, from a Mac to a Windows PC. When we talk about portability of C++ programs, we usually mean portability of source code; that is, the source code can be successfully compiled and run on a variety of systems. The ISO C++ standard defines two kinds of entities: - Core Language Features , such as built-in types and loops - Standard-library Components , such as containers and I/O operations C++ is a statically typed language. That is, the type of every entity (e.g., object, value, name, and expression) must be known to the compiler at its point of use. The type of an object determines the set of operations applicable to it. The Minimal C++ Program \u00b6 The minimal C++ program, which does nothing, but is valid, is given by the following source code. Please note, that C++ is a key-sensitive language and therefore makes a difference between capital and non-capital letters. minimal.cpp: int main () {} This code defines the so-called main function of the program. main is one of the keywords of the C++ programming language and cannot be used in another place. The main function defines the unique entry point for a program. A computer then runs the executable code starting at this entry point. The open and closed round Brackets () mean that the main function does not take any input arguments. Later, we will see that there is another possibility. The curly braces {} express grouping in C++ and indicate the start and end of the function body. The function body defines the implementation of a function and therefore contains the code that the function should execute. In the case of the main function the program starts by executing the first command enclosed by curly braces. In front of the function the respective return type is defined. In the case of the main function it has to be the type int . int is an abbreviation for integer and describes some sort of integral number. int is again a keyword of the language and can only be used in the context of a type. The value returned by main is the program's return value to the system. In most cases a non-zero value indicates failure (and a zero value success). If there is no return value this means the program has succeeded. We do not have to explicitly state the program succession but we could do with the following code snippet. int main () { return 0 ; } Here return is another keyword of the C++ programming language which defines the output value of a function AND exits from this function. Therefore if the return directive is executed then every following command will be ignored. Producing Output on the Terminal \u00b6 Typical programs should do something! Therefore we start with one of the most basic steps of printing 'Hello, World!' on the terminal. The following code snippet demonstrates this example. hello.cpp: #include <iostream> int main () { std :: cout << \"Hello, World! \\n \" ; } The command #include <iostream> instructs the C++ preprocessor to include all declarations (not the implementations) of the I/O routines of the C++ standard library found in the file 'iostream'. Only with these declarations the command std::cout << \"Hello, World!\\n\"; makes sense. cout is the standard object for printing information on the console. To use the formatted output, we write the streaming operator << before the argument \"Hello, World!\\n\" . The argument \"Hello, World!\\n\" is a string literal which means that it is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes. In C++ the backslash \\ in a string literal is an escape character to make it possible to write special characters, like the newline character \\n or the tab character \\t . At the end of every command there has to be a semicolon ; . std is a so-called namespace which shall be explained in more detail later. You only have to remember that every standard facility is put in the namespace std (an abbreviation for 'standard'). To use any function or class in this namespace we have three main possibilities. - preceding the command by std:: to make the namespace explicit like it was already shown - defining a using namespace std; directive somewhere in the file to make anything available - defining a using std::cout; directive to make only cout available Both examples will be shown for convenience. #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int main () { cout << \"Hello, World! \\n \" ; } #include <iostream> int main () { using std :: cout ; cout << \"Hello, World! \\n \" ; } Writing Comments \u00b6 Using comments, which are ignored by the compiler, in the source code is usually a good way of explaining the way of working of your code to other people and your future self. C++ gives two kinds of comment-styles. The first style is started by using // . This indicates that until the end of the line there is a comment which should be ignored by the compiler. int main () { // we put a one-line comment here } The other style starts with /* and ends with */ . So this style is not ended by any newline- or other special character. int main () { /* Here we can write our comment in more than one line! */ std :: cout /*We can even create a comment inside a statement!*/ << \"Hello, World \\n \" ; } Building the Examples \u00b6 In this folder the minimal C++ program and the program which prints 'Hello, World!' on the terminal, are already given as .cc files. This file extension is one of the many standard extensions like .cpp , .cxx and .c++ . You are free to chose one that suits your taste and needs. For compiling these code examples open a terminal inside this directory and run the following command to build the example code. The GCC compiler for C++ is called by the command g++ .

The last argument gives GCC the source file to be compiled. g++ -o minimal minimal.cc g++ -o hello hello.cc If there are no errors you should be able to see two executable files 'minimal' and 'hello' inside this directory. Execution \u00b6 The resulting applications can be called by using the following commands. ./minimal ./hello The program minimal is the minimal C++ program. Therefore there shoud be no output. But there should be no error message, either.

In general, the file hierarchy of a project should fulfill the following properties. - easy to maintain - easy to work with - self-explanatory - scalable - self-consistent - extensible by subprojects, documentation, scripts, external dependencies, examples, etc. - usable for different kinds of projects (eg. header-only libraries and projects for multiple applications and libraries) - compatible with C++ modules However, there are already some common folder structures for a C++ project. A typical one can be found here . Looking at other projects on GitHub, like doctest and Eigen , we can find a more modern approach. Personally, I would like to suggest the Canonical Project Structure developed by Boris Kolpackov which was already submitted to the C++ standard. Currently, it seems to fulfill every single requirement. Especially the application of such a structure to the process of developing a project from scratch does not introduce a major overhead in your workflow. It can be even used for a library realized by more than one project. It scales better to large code bases than prior project structures and is not as error-prone. The intrinsic support for executing integration tests independently of the build process after the installation is unique. Last but not least, putting headers, sources and unit tests inside the same directory structure prevents doubling of subtrees in the file hierarchy and makes the process of maintaining easier. The Canonical Project Structure is a really modern approach to handle the file hierarchy of a project without the typical drawbacks of other schemes. I would suggest to use it.","title":"C++ Project Structures"},{"location":"programming/c%2B%2B/course/01/","text":"Online C++ Course Notes: Lecture 1 \u00b6 Text Editor \u00b6 To actually write C++ source code, we need a text editor.

C++ gives two kinds of comment-styles. The first style is started by using // . This indicates that until the end of the line there is a comment which should be ignored by the compiler. int main () { // we put a one-line comment here } The other style starts with /* and ends with */ . So this style is not ended by any newline- or other special character. int main () { /* Here we can write our comment in more than one line! */ std :: cout /*We can even create a comment inside a statement!*/ << \"Hello, World \\n \" ; } Explanation of the Streaming Operator \u00b6 Before we go into the details of the C++ streaming operator << for cout , let us briefly discuss the mathematical addition \\(+\\) of two real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) . The addition is a mathematical operation. A mathematical operation is nothing more than a function with a change of notation to make it more useful. The typical notation for the addition is given by the following expression. \\[ x+y \\] This formulation does not directly result from its definition. Looking at the typical definition for operations like \\(+\\) , we get something like the following. \\[ +:\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R} \\ ,\\quad (a,b) \\mapsto +(a,b) \\] This would mean that the expression \\(x+y\\) would have to be expressed as below. \\[ +(x,y) \\] For convenience, in mathematics one makes those expressions interchangeable by definition. \\[ +(x,y) = x+y \\] Hence, if we would like to add three real numbers \\(x\\) , \\(y\\) , and \\(z\\) , we could write the following. \\[ x + y + z = (x+y)+z = +(x,y) + z = +(+(x,y),z) \\] In programming, the procedure used for the left-hand side is typically called chaining because we are able to chain all additions by only adding another \\(+\\) and a variable. The change of notation for mathematical operations, like \\(+\\) , \\(\\times\\) , or \\(\\frac{\\cdot}{\\cdot}\\) , makes it easier to express a specific intention. In C++, the concept of mathematical operations does exist as well. The functions of these mathematical operations are called operators and can be implemented by the programmer like any other function. But as before, to use them one has to change to the notation of mathematical operations. The operator << is a mathematical operation which takes a so-called output stream, like cout , as its first argument, and a variable to be printed to the output stream as the second argument. To enable the chaining mechanism as for the \\(+\\) operation, << always returns its first argument. cout << x ; // <=> <<(cout, x) = cout cout << \"x = \" << x ; // <=> <<(<<(cout, \"x = \"), x) = cout // <<(<<(<<(cout, \"x = \"), x), '\\n') = cout <=> cout << \"x = \" << x << '\\n' ; Fibonacci Sequence \u00b6 The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence \\(f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers such that for all \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) the following holds. \\[ f(1)=1 \\ ,\\qquad f(2)=1 \\ ,\\qquad f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n) \\] The first few elements of this sequence are shown below. It is used as a typical programming example. \\[ (f(n))_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} = (1\\,,\\ 1\\,,\\ 2\\,,\\ 3\\,,\\ 5\\,,\\ 8\\,,\\ 13\\,,\\ 21\\,,\\ 34\\,,\\ 55\\,,\\ 89\\,,\\ \\ldots) \\] Our goal is it to implement an algorithm which will generate a certain amount of those numbers and print it to the screen. For this, create a new folder in your course folder and open your text editor. $ pwd /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course $ mkdir 03-fibonacci $ ls 01-hello 02-input 03-fibonacci $ subl . Go into the new folder and create a new main.cpp file. $ cd 03-fibonacci $ pwd /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/03-fibonacci $ touch main.cpp For Loop \u00b6 If we want to apply the computation rule for the Fibonacci sequence several times to be able to print more than a few values on the screen, we need a loop which is repeating parts of the code we have written. In C++, one typically uses the so-called for loop. for ( /* Initial Statement */ ; /* Loop Condition */ ; /* Iteration Statement */ ){ /* Loop Block */ } Before the for loop starts, the initial statement is executed. The for loop repeats the contents of its loop block as long as its loop condition is true. At the end of each loop block, it executes the iteration statement. A typical example is given below. for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++ i ){ cout << i << '\\n' ; } Here, the initial statement is given by int i = 0 . It defines a local variable i of type int which is only applicable in the block of the for loop, and initializes it with 0 . The loop condition is given by i < 10 . So as long as the variable i is smaller than 10 the loop block will be repeated. The iteration statement is given by ++ i . After every loop block it makes sure to increment i by 1 . In the loop block, we can use the locally defined variable i to print it for example. Applying the for loop to the Fibonacci problem, we get something like the following. #include <iostream> using namespace std ; int main (){ int f_1 = 1 ; int f_2 = 1 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++ i ) { cout << \"f(\" << i + 1 << \") = \" << f_1 << \" \\n \" ; int f_tmp = f_1 + f_2 ; f_1 = f_2 ; f_2 = f_tmp ; } } We have defined two starting values f_1 and f_2 as integers. Afterwards, we directly start with the loop and print the first argument on the screen. The actual computation of the Fibonacci sequence happens after the output. int f_tmp = f_1 + f_2 ; f_1 = f_2 ; f_2 = f_tmp ; In the locally defined integer variable f_tmp , we store newly computed next Fibonacci element. At this point, we do no longer need the value of f_1 . Hence, we will store the value of f_2 in f_1 to be able to store f_tmp in f_2 . By computing the element \\(f(n+2)\\) , we will therefore assume that the old value of \\(f(n+1)\\) is stored in f_2 and the value of \\(f(n)\\) is stored in f_1 . For the next iteration, \\(f(n+1)\\) has to become \\(f(n)\\) , \\(f(n+2)\\) has to become \\(f(n+1)\\) , and \\(f(n)\\) is no longer needed. Compilation with Custom Output Name \u00b6 For compiling the code, this time, we will use a so-called flag to directly name the output executable. For g++ , this can be done by writing -o and afterwards adding the name of your executable. g++ -o fibonacci main.cpp List the content of your folder and run your code. $ pwd /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/03-fibonacci $ ls main.cpp $ g++ -o fibonacci main.cpp $ ls fibonacci* main.cpp $ ./fibonacci f(1) = 1 f(2) = 1 f(3) = 2 f(4) = 3 f(5) = 5 f(6) = 8 f(7) = 13 f(8) = 21 f(9) = 34 f(10) = 55 Starting with Functions \u00b6 void print_fibonacci ( int n ){...} #include <iostream> using namespace std ; void print_fibonacci ( int n ) { int f_1 = 1 ; int f_2 = 1 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) { cout << \"f(\" << i + 1 << \") = \" << f_1 << \" \\n \" ; int f_tmp = f_1 + f_2 ; f_1 = f_2 ; f_2 = f_tmp ; } } int main () { print_fibonacci ( 10 ); } // Declaration: Used for the interface. void print_fibonacci ( int n ); // Implementation: Used for the actual computation. void print_fibonacci ( int n ){...} #include <iostream> using namespace std ; void print_fibonacci ( int n ); int main () { print_fibonacci ( 10 ); } void print_fibonacci ( int n ) { int f_1 = 1 ; int f_2 = 1 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) { cout << \"f(\" << i + 1 << \") = \" << f_1 << \" \\n \" ; int f_tmp = f_1 + f_2 ; f_1 = f_2 ; f_2 = f_tmp ; } } Exercises \u00b6 Prompt the user of the program to input a number. Use this number as count of elements of the Fibonacci sequence to be printed on the terminal. Add a second and a third argument to print_fibonacci function to parameterize the starting values of f_1 and f_2 . Test your implementation by calling the function in main several times with different argument values.","title":"Online C++ Course Notes: Lecture 2"},{"location":"programming/c%2B%2B/course/02/#online-c-course-notes-lecture-2","text":"","title":"Online C++ Course Notes: Lecture 2"},{"location":"programming/c%2B%2B/course/02/#writing-comments","text":"Using comments, which are ignored by the compiler, in the source code is usually a good way of explaining the way of working of your code to other people and your future self.

Typically, a semicolon is ending an expression and therefore making it a statement. Most of the time, we will use semicolon to mark those statements which are actually executing instructions on the processor. This means, for now, that we will find those semicolon mostly inside of scope blocks marked by the curly braces { and } . Commas on the other hand can be used to group several expressions into one bigger statement. This is a technique that will not be used at the beginning. So as a consequence for us, commas will be used when declaring, defining, or using functions inside their list of arguments to separate single elements. void print_fibonacci ( int n , int f_1 , int f_2 ); print_fibonacci ( n , 1 , 1 ); void print_fibonacci ( int n , int f_1 , int f_2 ){...} The for loop is not a function. Hence, we use semicolon to separate the expressions in the parentheses (...) . for ( int i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) {...} Text Editor Configuration and Clang Format \u00b6 Most of our work will be done inside the text editor. For a productive workflow, it is therefore necessary to make use of features provided by the text editor, such as automatic file saving, fast file generation, shortcuts, fast file switching, project organization and handling, and automatic formatting. Learning and internalizing such features takes up a huge amount of time. Thus, we will strive for learning them step by step. For those who use Sublime Text as their main text editor, please take a look at our recommended Sublime Text configuration and carefully read the instructions. Furthermore, make sure to install Clang Format by using your system's package manager. This will enable the automatic formatting of your C++ code every time it is saved. Arch-based Linux Distributions: sudo pacman -S clang Debian-based Linux Distributions: sudo apt update && sudo apt install clang-format Sublime Text Useful Shortcuts \u00b6 If the following shortcuts do not suit your needs, do not hesitate to change them in the Sublime Text settings. ctrl + alt + n : Open the small command palette at the bottom of Sublime Text and type in the name of the file relative to project root that should be created. ctrl + s : Manually save the currently opened file and automatically use Clang Format on it. Focus Lost: Automatically save the file for which we have lost the focus and automatically apply Clang Format. alt + n : Open or close the command palette of Sublime Text. alt + f : Open or close the file palette in Sublime Text to switch between every possible in the currently opened project. ctrl + b : Run the integrated build system of Sublime Text to compile and run single C++ files.
